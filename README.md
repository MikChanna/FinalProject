# Description

Lilypad is a MERN application which allows parents (or other permanent caregivers) to easily share information with temporary caregivers, such as nannies, babysitters, or family members who might be watching over their children.

Users can store information about each of their children, inluding: allergies, bedtime, food preferences, favorite activities, etc, allowing caregivers to easily access this important information all in one, convenient place. It also allows for the reuseabilty of this information, and prevents parents from having to repeat themselves to the various different people who may look after their children.

Lilypad also includes an interface which parents and caregivers can use to chat and interact if issues or questions arise, as well as browse child-related content if they want to search for fun games to play, look up age-appropriate media, etc.

# Usage

This is a command-line application intended for interaction within the terminal. By running the command "npm node", the application prompts users with a series of questions, their answers to which will become the content of a well-structured README file for whatever project they are working on.
